  abstract = {Modern large language model (LLM) developers typically conduct a safety alignment to prevent an LLM from generating unethical or harmful content. Recent studies have discovered that the safety alignment of LLMs can be bypassed by jailbreaking prompts. These prompts are designed to create specific conversation scenarios with a harmful question embedded. Querying an LLM with such prompts can mislead the model into responding to the harmful question. The stochastic and random nature of existing genetic methods largely limits the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art (SOTA) jailbreaking attacks. In this paper, we propose RL-JACK, a novel black-box jailbreaking attack powered by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We formulate the generation of jailbreaking prompts as a search problem and design a novel RL approach to solve it. Our method includes a series of customized designs to enhance the RL agent's learning efficiency in the jailbreaking context. Notably, we devise an LLM-facilitated action space that enables diverse action variations while constraining the overall search space. We propose a novel reward function that provides meaningful dense rewards for the agent toward achieving successful jailbreaking. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that RL-JACK is overall much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six SOTA LLMs, including large open-source models and commercial models. We also show the RL-JACK's resiliency against three SOTA defenses and its transferability across different models. Finally, we validate the insensitivity of RL-JACK to the variations in key hyper-parameters.},

  abstract = {One key challenge in backdoor attacks against large foundation models is the resource limits. Backdoor attacks usually require retraining the target model, which is impractical for very large foundation models. Existing backdoor attacks are mainly designed for supervised classifiers or small foundation models (e.g., BERT). None of these attacks has successfully compromised a very large foundation model, such as Llama-3-70B, especially with limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose TrojFM, a novel backdoor attack tailored for very large foundation models. Our primary technical contribution is the development of a novel backdoor injection method. This method forces a backdoored model to generate similar hidden representations for poisoned inputs regardless of their actual semantics. Our approach injects such backdoors by fine-tuning only a very small proportion of model parameters. This enables TrojFM to efficiently launch downstream task-agnostic backdoor attacks against very large foundation models under limited computational resources. Moreover, we optimize the fine-tuning process with our customized QLoRA technique, enabling launching our attack via only~\textit{one A100 GPU}. Furthermore, we design a new trigger injection method to ensure our attack stealthiness. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate that TrojFM can launch effective backdoor attacks against widely used large GPT-style models without jeopardizing their normal functionalities (and outperforming existing attacks on BERT-style models). Furthermore, we show that TrojFM is resilient to SOTA defenses and is insensitive to changes in key hyper-parameters. Finally, we conduct a resource analysis to quantify that our method can significantly save computational and memory costs compared to existing backdoor attacks.},
