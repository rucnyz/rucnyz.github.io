  abstract={Multi-modal clustering aims at finding a clustering structure shared by the data of different modalities in an unsupervised way. Currently, solving this problem often relies on two assumptions: i) the multi-modal data own the same latent distribution, and ii) the observed multi-modal data are well-aligned and without any missing modalities. Unfortunately, these two assumptions are often questionable in practice and thus limit the feasibility of many multi-modal clustering methods. In this work, we develop a new multi-modal clustering method based on the Gromovization of optimal transport distance, which relaxes the dependence on the above two assumptions. In particular, given the data of different modalities, whose correspondence is unknown, our method learns the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) barycenter of their kernel matrices. Driven by the modularity maximization principle, the GW barycenter helps to explore the clustering structure shared by different modalities. Moreover, the GW barycenter is associated with the GW distances between the different modalities to the clusters, and the optimal transport plans corresponding to the GW distances help to achieve the alignment and the clustering of the multi-modal data jointly. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-modal clustering methods, especially when the data are (partially or completely) unaligned.

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
