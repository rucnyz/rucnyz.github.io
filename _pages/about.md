I am a first-year PhD student at Purdue University in the Department of Computer Science. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wenbo Guo](https://henrygwb.github.io/). I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/en), where I was advised by [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io/).
My current research interests focus on AI security and AI for security.
